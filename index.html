i literally cannot even begin to stress how much this game means to me and how well it has captured the reality of highschool. it's the most ground-breaking game that has come out in a long, long time. i feel like it definitely deserves a lot more recognition for what it has accomplished. it has quite literally changed the way i view the world around me in the most positive way possible. i love it so much, and do NOT even get me started on how much i love the second game life is strange 2.<br/>
passing tourists<br/>
life is strange and life is strange 2 have helped me through so many rough patches in my life.<br/>
